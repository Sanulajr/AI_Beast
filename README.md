AI Image Creator (Skeleton Version)

A simple, front-end-only website where users can input a prompt and click to generate four AI-created images. This is an initial, basic version aimed at testing functionality for a larger project.

Features
- Prompt Input: Users can type a prompt to guide image generation.
- Image Generation: Four images are displayed based on the prompt after clicking the "Generate" button.
- Simple UI: Basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for quick user interaction and seamless functionality.

Tech Stack
- HTML: Structure of the website.
- CSS: Basic styling for a clean, minimalistic interface.
- JavaScript: Handles prompt submission and image display logic.

How to Use
1. Open the website.
2. Enter a descriptive prompt (e.g., "sunset over mountains").
3. Click the "Generate" button to view four generated images based on the prompt.

Future Plans
- Adding a back-end model for improved image generation.
- Enhancing UI/UX for a more interactive experience.
- Expanding features like saving, sharing, and customizing images.
